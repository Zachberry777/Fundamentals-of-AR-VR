This is what I have done so far after milestone 3 and the presentation.
I have work on unity for a couple hours or so since. I do need to do more and I will get it done.
I am able to place mutiple prefabs and have a cloud going. I still need to be able to stack and snap 
blocks togehter. I also need to make the blocks smaller, that will only take 30 minutes to fix.
I will work on getting the blocks to stack by thhe end of the week. I am coming along and I want to be over
half way done by the end of the week.
