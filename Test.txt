So when I search AR and what it is used for, it comes up with education, communication, medicine, and entertainment. 
I feel like it would be best used for the medical world. AR allows us to see things through camera that are not actually there.
For example, the popular game of 2016, Pokemon Go. This game allowed the people to play a game on their phone through camera 
and capture pokemon through the camera view, like the creature was actually there in real life. AR is a very cool way to 
connect with people, and for entertainment. The best use for this, in my opinion would be for people in college or learning 
about things in the medical feild. For example, What if you took a test through your phone camera and had to select the right 
amount of fluids in a bag to use on some patients, or had to pick the right tool for a surgery that you were helping with. 
I feel like this would be very helpful to learn. It would be more vissually learning, and more hands on, without being to hands on.
