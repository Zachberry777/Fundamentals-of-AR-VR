I ended up using the A frame VR since it was the only one I could really figure out. 
I am really bad with coding even after 2 classes. It is kind of like Me being a NBA player 
and i am 5"6', this will never work out in the NBA because im to short. I feel the same way 
with coding, Its for some people and people like me who will always have a hard time understanding. 
I dont know why it doesn't click with me, so to me its a little frustrating. I did manage to get shapes and 
new colors in the coding. I tried to put new skin texture on with a image but couldnt figure that
out. Overall it was hard but i did get it done without being a week and a half late this time, 
so i count it as a win.
