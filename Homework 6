Purpose of application:
The purpose of my application was for entertainment. I wanted my app to be a click and bring you somewhere. 
Mainly i wanted the app to be fun and happy. The heart brings you to a link on youtube that is of spongbob episode,
and says i love you. The othere icon plays a happy song for you. The Ring brings you to a link of sonic because
of rings. The cube brings you to a funny batman video of a kid. The drop icon plays another song for you. The last icon, 
the star brings you to a relaxing jazz video that plays for a couple hours to relax. 


Feedback from testers:
So i had my wife test out the app and this is what feedback i got. She thought it would be a point anywhere and play. 
But you had to look at the computer to play it, So you are very limited to where you look through the lens. 
She liked the videos and was entertaining like the app should be. When you play the song ones without the links
they keep playing and they both can play at the same time and can be annoying. But over all the app was fun and relaxing.
