  So I am writing this paper because we could not figure out why my computer wouldn't take the code. 
My computer is older and that might be a good reason of why. I worked for a good 4ish hours
trying to get this assignment to work. I even had my wife come in and try to help and yet the path 
would not work or be found on git. I went into my search and worked on putting in the right 
path and still came up negative in Unity. 
  What would of happend if I were to get this to work, Is first I would have gotten cardboard VR 
to work with unity. I would have had to gone into package handler and do some things. I then
would get Unity to work with android and build and run it from there. After making sure it 
ran with android I would set up the players setting. From here in players setting it would
have created a way for a player to look around im guessing. From there i would move on to XR 
and get it to project on to VR mode. Last after getting it to VR mode, I would build my objects and scene.
I would have created some blocks and such. Last i would write about my experience which is this paper I
am writing now. That was my experience with this project, I found it difficult because of the path and 
this took a good week to get all the way to here.
